# about-me
My name is jerfenson Cerda mejia, I was born on November 17, 1996, in the Dominican Republic A small country In the Carribean. I lived a majority of my childhood there until I was 11 and moved to
the United States. My childhood wasn't great since I struggled with school and spend most of the time in the streets. My mother lived in the United States and My father was there, but I didn't have a great
relationship with him. I didn't have anyone to really guide me, so I spend my time in the streets and skipping school. When I turned seven, things started to change. An internet Cafe opened in my neighborhood and I spent all my time in the Cafe playing videos games and exploring the Internet. It was the first time I ever played or used the Internet on a computer. It was an amazing first experience that changed me for the better. 
When I turned eleven, I moved to the United States with my mom.  Here my I became even more intrigued with technology, I wanted to learn everything about computers, how videos games were created and also websites.  My first career thought was to become a videos game designer because I was so amazed how video games developers created games with such high resolution and mechanics. 





My name is Jerfenson Cerda Mejia. I'm currently a freshman at Allegheny College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Economics. After I graduate from Allegheny, I'm planning on
going to Washington University for my masters degree on Computer Engineering.
