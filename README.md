# about-me

Jerfenson Cerda Mejia

#### TL;DR:



 I was born on November 17, 1996, in the Dominican Republic a small country in the Caribbean. I lived a majority of my childhood there until I was 11 and moved to the United States. My childhood wasn't great since I struggled with school and spend most of the time in the streets. My mother lived in the United States and My father was there, but I didn't have a great relationship with him. I didn't have anyone to really guide me, so I spend my time in the streets and skipping school. When I turned seven, things started to change. An Internet Cafe opened in my neighborhood and I spent all my time in the Internet Cafe playing video games and exploring the Internet. It was the first time I ever played or used the Internet on a computer. It was an amazing first experience that changed me for the better.

When I turned eleven, I moved to the United States with my mom. Here my I became even more intrigued with technology, I wanted to learn everything about computers, how videos games were created and also websites. My first career thought was to become a video game designer because I was so amazed how video games developers created games with such high resolution and mechanics. As I interacted more with computers and videos games, I became curios of how these things were created and worked. My curiosity took me to the world of computer programing language.

The first programing language I started learning was HTML and CSS. From there a went beyond that and started applying to small coding boot camps for high school students. I had the opportunity to get into CodeNow where I had the chance to spend two weeks learning Ruby from professional coders that worked in big tech companies. Programing became a central factor in my life, I a just wanted to learn more about it.
